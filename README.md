# Simple dictionary in C

## Observation
- Still in development. Run `make` for a list of self-explanatory options.
- If you want to try `hashtest.py`, you have to run `python3 setup.py install` to build and install the C extension used by `hashtest.py`
    - Note that you **must** change the first include in `calculations.c` for the module installation to succeed. Open the file and read the first comment, it explains the situation.
